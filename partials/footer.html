            <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">FYV! is a small project and brainchild of Tim Maddux, student at Nashville Software School. The idea is simple: our state legislators do <em>actually</em>  read the emails that constituents send. This is a site that helps you find and save bills on issues close to your heart, and then attempts to nudge you in the direction of getting a simple email out to your state senator or representative. To get started, <a class="yellow-text" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzvY48iNQOgycFZxN3RIb2RwVkE/view?usp=sharing">click here to down a current list</a> of all state legislators with all their contact info. You can use this list to upload to your contacts list using pretty much every email program out there. Don't know how?
