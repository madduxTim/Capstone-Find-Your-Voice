            <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">FYV! is a small test project by <a class="yellow-text" href="http://www.timmaddux.com">Tim Maddux</a>. The idea is simple: to encourage users to contact their state legislators with their thoughts about specific bills. The application helps locate bills by keyword search, and gives the user the ability to save a bill to their specific login. It then attempts to nudge them in the direction of getting a simple email out to your state senator or representative. To get started, <a class="yellow-text" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HtcpQQVjHANA-lSlh4Dg71yaXSseiZwYbE4YGM8lL-I/edit?usp=sharing">click here to down a current list</a> of all state legislators with all their contact info. You can use this list to upload to your contacts list using pretty much every email program out there. Don't know how?
